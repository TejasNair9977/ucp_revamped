# UCP Revamped
## Abstract
We all know the number of deaths caused due to human and machine error in industrial workplaces, factories, due to radiations and chemical leaks is a lot. So, our application's sole purpose is to reduce these hazardous problems as much as possible by suggesting preventive measures before any major issues occur. We mapped out the problems we could possibly see, thechallenges we could face, and the ways in which we could overcome them. With this knowledge, the control panel gives us all the necessary information that we need in order to overcome any sort of danger or even better, prevent any sort of disaster, that may have unfolded without the help of the control panel.

## How to use
You need to have QT installed, and you need to open the .pro file on QT Creator. This will allow you to modify the GUI and cpp codes as you please.
You can contribute by simply forking, saving locally, modifying with QT, committing and pushing, and then submitting a pull request. If your contributions are beneficial to the project, they will be added to the repo.

## Who are we helping?
Our project aims to be used in the industrial sector, where most of the accidents related to chemicals, radiation, and anything mechanical happens. For example, nuclear power plants, biofuel plants, textile industries, etc.
The reason we want to do this project is because we recognize that deaths in industries are something that can be completely avoided, and making something that helps people, in of itself, is something that feels like an incredible feat.

## How do we test this?
For the simulation of this project, to emulate the environments that would originally be tough to check in real life scenarios, we will use simulators to check if the control panel can handle those changes and combinations of scenarios. We had to do extensive research on both of these applications and hardware, so that we could get a clear idea of how they work, and how they would react to certain scenarios. We finally, also had to do quantitative research on how changes should affect the control panel realistically, so that changes in the simulated devices are as close to real life scenarios as possible.
